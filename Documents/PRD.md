* **Project Scope**: The prototype is strictly a homepage hero without navigation, links, or secondary pages.
* **Purpose**: To establish a premium, cinematic, and authoritative brand gateway for "Figuring Out".
* **Target Audience**: Ambitious professionals and founders aged 20–45 seeking high-signal content.
* **Visual Aesthetic**: A documentary-style layout using a full-bleed, right-aligned background image without any vignette.
* **Headline Specifications**: A maximum 10–12 word editorial H1 constrained to 3 lines, featuring a single highlighted italicized word in gold.
* **Subheadline Requirements**: A short 12–15 word supporting line explaining the core promise.
* **Call to Action**: A single, visually interactive "Listen Now" button that logs clicks but does not redirect.
* **Motion System**: Incorporates subtle animations including a 7-second micro-zoom (1.00 to 1.03), pointer parallax, staggered word reveals, and a low-opacity static grain texture.
* **Tracking Metrics**: The prototype must log baseline events including load timestamps, reveal completions, CTA clicks, and scroll attempts.
